    "context": "New research conducted in Costa Rica reveals that insects are not actually attracted to artificial light at night but rather confused by it. Scientists observed insects circling artificial light sources, exhibiting a behavior known as dorsal light response, where they keep their backs to the light. This behavior suggests that insects mistake artificial light for the sky, which they use for navigation. The study disproves previous theories that insects are drawn to light for warmth or because they mistake it for the moon. Instead, artificial light disrupts their navigation, causing them to orbit the light source or exhibit other erratic flight patterns. This disruption can have detrimental effects on insect populations, impacting essential activities like pollination and mating. Researchers recommend reducing artificial light pollution to mitigate these negative effects on insects.",
